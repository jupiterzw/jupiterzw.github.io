My name is Zhiyu Wang (Peter). I am currently a master student in  mathematics at University of Oxofrd. Prior to that, I received BSc in Mathematics from University College London. My academic interests lie in *statistical and computational learning theory*, *Theories of Deep Learning*, as well as *theoretical neuroscience*, fields which I believe provide important insights into understanding intelligence. I am also interested in *Rough Path Theory* and *Stochastic Analysis*.

- [Asymptotic Analysis for Scattering off One-Dimensional Compactly Supported Weak Potentials](/assets/img/Scattering.pdf)

Leisure
* Proficient at piano and chess
