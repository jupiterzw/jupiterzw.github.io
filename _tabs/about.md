My name is Zhiyu Wang (Peter). I am currently an undergraduate mathematics student at University College London. My academic interests lie in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience, fields which I believe provide important insights into understanding intelligence.

Though I currently lack the time for formal study, I enjoy exploring the foundations of mathematics. By far, my favourite theorem is GÃ¶del's First Incompleteness Theorem. I hope to one day fully comprehend its intricacies and go over some pivotal areas that shaped the foundations of mathematics, including Category Theory, Model Theory, Forcing and the Continuum Hypothesis, and Large Cardinals. Of course, that's assuming I don't get distracted by new movies or funny cat videos on the internet:)
